# EnergyTradingDissertationModel
 This is my attempt at modeling an intraday energy trading scenario for three different locations. I use the Gurobi platform to optimize revenue over the course of June 2019 for a commercial building energy system with a solar plant, on-site energy storage and an electric heat pump flexible load. Implemented for three locations in Spain, Germany and the UK.
